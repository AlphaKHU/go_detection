Introduction
============

Imago is a program for automatic processing of Go images. It takes an image (or
a set of images), finds the board-grid and stones and produces an abstract
representation of the game situation (or a game record).

It will supports JPEG, BMP, TIFF (and other) image formats on input. It is
capable of output to ASCII and SGF format. As the process is fully
automatic, the program is operated from command line.
