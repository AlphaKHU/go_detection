Introduction
============

Imago will be a program for automatic processing of Go images. It will take an image (or a set of images), find the board-grid and stones and produce an abstract representation of the game situation (or a game record).

It will support JPEG, BMP, TIFF (and other) image formats on input. It will be capable of output to ASCII and SGF format. As the process should be fully automatic, the program will be operated from command line. There will, however, be a GUI for manual grid location in case the automatic one should fail.
